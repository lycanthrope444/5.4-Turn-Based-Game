# Fight Land

## Synopsis

This is a turn-based game inspired by 80's style horror films. This was a group
project and was a great experience to learn how to cooperate on coding projects.

## Code Info

This project uses Handlebars, jQuery and Bootstrap. The code does reflect three
new coders working together, but the final product works pretty well.
